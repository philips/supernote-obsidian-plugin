# Supernote Obsidian Plugin

This plugin generates PNGs for any `*.note` files found in your Obsidian Vault. The PNGs will be named based on the filename of the note and the page number of the note like so: `test.note-0.png`, `test.note-1.png`.

  - `eslint main.ts`
  - eslint will then create a report with suggestions for code improvement by file and line number.
- If your source code is in a folder, such as `src`, you can use eslint with this command to analyze all files in that folder:
  - `eslint .\src\`
